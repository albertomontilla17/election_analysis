# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit
 
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Colorado Congressional elections using Python, to determine a list of results from the audit. 

## Analysis and Challenges

In this module, I am beginning to learn how powerful Python is. It is interesting how a variable created by yourself can become a game changer in the entire project, Also, the reader function is an element that will allow us to work with external files in a very comfortable way.

I created a script that is capable to give us the following results:
