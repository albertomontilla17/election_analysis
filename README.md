# Election_Analysis


## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to analyze the Colorado Congressional elections using Python, to determine a list of results from the audit. 

## Analysis and Challenges

In this module, I am beginning to learn how powerful Python is. It is interesting how a variable created by yourself can become a game changer in the entire project, Also, the reader function is an element that will allow us to work with external files in a very comfortable way.

I created a script that is capable to give us the following results:

## Election-Audit Results

### - Total Votes Cast

> - **369,711**

### - County Votes
    
> - **Jefferson** county has `10.5%` total percentage with a total votes of **38,855**
> - **Denver** county has the `82.8%` total percentage with a total votes of **306,055**
> - **Arapahoe** county has `6.7%` total percentage with a total votes of **24,801**

### - County with larger number of votes

> - **Denver**, with **306,055** votes and the *82,8%* vote percentage***

### - Candidate percentage of votes

> - **Charles Casper Stockham** candidate has `23.0%` total percentage with a total votes of **85,213**
> - **Diana DeGette** candidate has the `73.8` total percentage with a total votes of **272,892**
> - **Raymon Anthony Doane** candidate has `3.1%` total percentage with a total votes of **11,606**

### - Election Results

> - **Diana DeGette** won the election, with a total votes of **272,892**
> - In addition, **Diana DeGette** has the total percentage votes of `73.8%`

This data is reflected on the text file created by the script

## Electon-Audit Summary

This script is created to be used with any other election-audit in the future. I will show you how it can be used in the following images

> - With the variables already created, another set of data can be loaded, and the for loop will fill the variables with the respective candidates and their  votes.

![Empty variables to load](https://github.com/albertomontilla17/election_analysis/blob/main/Resources/variables.png)

> - The data is going to be reflected in a text file with the name of your analysis

> - The message on the text file can be modified.

![Modify text](https://github.com/albertomontilla17/election_analysis/blob/main/Resources/modify_text.png)

> - The variable names and the format of the numbers can be modified as well

> - The number of candidates and counties would be automatically modified thanks to the for loop created on the script
